* Description
  This layer is for personal information management (pim) and sets up the following:
  - =notmuch= (Email)
  - =org= (Notes / Workflow)
  - =org-octopress= (Blog)
  - =org-journal= (Journal)

* Install

** 1. Download layer

  Add this repository to your spacemacs private folder as a submodule under the
  folder =pim=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git submodule -b master add https://github.com/admiralakber/myOS-spacemacs-pim ~/.emacs.d/private/pim
  #+END_SRC

** 2. IMPORTANT Customize / Configure

  Edit [[file:config.el][=config.el=]] with your details.

** 3. Load layer

  To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need
  to add =pim= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
  file.

* Usage

** Email

   This layer provides configuration for emacs to view / compose emails using
   [[https://notmuchmail.org/notmuch-emacs/][notmuch-emacs]]. Sending, receiving and organising of these emails are done
   independently. Setting up in this manner provides fantastic speed,
   flexibility, and robustness.

   For an example setup of email back end end see
   [[https://github.com/admiralakber/myOS-email][github.com/admiralakber/myOS-email]]

** Journal

   Org mode journaling is configured in org-pim and utilizes [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal][org-journal]].
   Spacemacs like bindings are based off [[https://github.com/borgnix/spacemacs-journal/][borgnix's layer.]]

   Prettier defaults (in my opinion) are configured in [[file:config.el][=config.el=]].

** Blogging

   Going from an org file to a blog post is made easy with [[https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopresshttps://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopresshttps://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress][org-octopress]] using
   jekyll to generate the blog.

*** How do I even?

   If you don't already have a blog, the easiest way to get started is with
   [[https://pages.github.com/][Github Pages]] as it automatically compiles your page with jekyll. There are
   plenty of tutorials on how to do this, the easiest way could even be looking
   at other peoples =<username>.github.io= repositories. This repository will be
   your =org-octopress-directory-top= variable defined in [[file:config.el][=config.el=]].

   Keep in mind, jekyll is very flexible. If you're looking at other peoples
   =github.io= repositories, or following tutorials they might not be using org
   files to generate =_post= files. Once you're at this point, see the
   [[https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress][org-octopress]] documentation or [[https://github.com/admiralakber/admiralakber.github.io][this github.io]] for an example.
